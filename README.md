# Oghma Infinium

A compilation of records and information

Information labelled as unverfied (eg "[UNVERIFED SOURCE]") should NOT be written off as invalid. This only means that the owner of this repository (z3c0) has not found/vetted the origin of the information. If you know any information that would enrich this repository (of which there is undoubtedly plenty), fork the repo and submit a merge request. This applies similarly to error corrections, revisions to developing events, or mistranslations.
